\section{Parallel architecture design}

The parallel version consists in a pipeline of three steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item pick one by one the windows from the input stream and pushes them in an input queue;
    \item pops the tasks from the input queue, compute the skyline of the windows and pushes the skylines in an output queue;
    \item pops and consumes skylines from the output queue.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
Since the second step is the one that can scale, it can also be seen as an emitter that picks the windows, a set of workers that compute the skylines and a collector that consumes the skylines.
